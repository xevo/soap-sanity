This module uses its companion script, wsdl2perl.pl,
to generate Moo based objects from a WSDL.

Start by running the wsdl2perl.pl script, passing it the location of the WSDL:

    $ cd scripts
    $ perl wsdl2perl.pl --wsdl http://example.com/path/to/wsdl

The objects will be generated into a directory called lib,
inside of your current working directory.

You can then look at the auto generated client module's
POD to see how to call each method in the API.

The client module will be called something like:
lib/SOAP/Sanity/SomeServiceClient.pm

You can find more detailed POD in the wsdl2perl.pl script.
